# Overview
There are 2 schematics in the Robot_Wiring_Schem.asc file, the high-level power/signal diagram is at the top while the low-level connection schematic is at the bottom with the title block. The 2 H-Bridges, Motor controller, Jetson, and LiDAR.
# High-level schematic (top of file)
<br/>The high-level schematic exists for current-characteristic visualization, the decisions behind wire gauging can be clearly traced back to the current specs seen here. The current specs were determined from absolute maximums from datasheets for each of the visualized components.
# Low-level schematic (bottom of file)
<br/>The low-level schematic visualizes all of the connections made in AWGR's electrical/data transmission systems. The schematic can NOT be run for simulation purposes, LTSpice was simply used as a drawing software.
